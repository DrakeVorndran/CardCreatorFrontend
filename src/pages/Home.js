      <p>In it's current state, Card Creator is a deck of cards you can mess around with onine with your friends in real time!</p>
      <h3>But We have big Ambitions!</h3>
      <p>The goal is to make a platform to create and share new and exciting card games with the world</p>
      <p>For now just hop into a game and play around with it.</p>
      <p>Because there arent any enforced rules, you have to do that yourself, </p>
      <p>but you can play many games just like you would with a real deck of cards. </p>
